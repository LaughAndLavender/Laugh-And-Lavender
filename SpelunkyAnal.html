<h1> An Analysis Of Spelunky </h1>
<p> It's not every day that I come across a game as good as Spelunky. If you don't know what the game is, it is,
as best summarized by Steam as "Spelunky is a unique platformer with randomized levels that offer a challenging new experience each time you play. Journey deep underground and explore fantastic places filled with all manner of monsters, traps, and treasure. You'll have complete freedom while you navigate the fully-destructible environments"
The game itself is painstakingly difficult. Because of the way that the levels generate, you can always gain some sense of direction
while always having no idea what you're doing. This is especially true in the beginning, before you've learned to deal with everything
the game throws at you.</p>
<p>Spelunky provides a multitude of challenges, and heavily rewards taking big risks. One such example of these is 
going to hell. Hell is a secret world in spelunky, that can only be accessed through a large number of seemingly obscure steps.
They are, in order: Get the Udjat Eye from the mines(The first world) Then, in the second world you need to visit the black market, which is a secret
level that is incredibly well hidden that you use the Udjat Eye to help find. The item that you need in the black market is the Ankh,
It can only be found in this level and you have to purchase it for 50,000 gold. Alternativley, you can take a massive risk killing tens of shopkeepers(one of the strongest enemies in the game)
To steal everything in the black market. You then need to travel through the next world. And kill yourself on the level that has the moai head on it.
The Ankh will then activate, saving your life and spawning you inside of the moai head, giving you the item you need and giving an exit to the level as well.
Using the item that you get from that, you need to travel to the next world, and kill Anubis, another incredibly difficult enemy.
From there, you simply need to use the item you got from the last world, and the item you get from killing Anubis, to open up a golden door.
The golden door will open up the city of gold, that has the book of the dead in the center. Take the book of the dead, rekill Anubis, and make it to the final level.
At the final level, an easy bossfight against Olmec, a golden statue that slams into the ground, you need to run around the arena until the book of the dead's teeth 
start gnashing, you need to get Olmec to destroy the entire area down from there, and then jump on his head as he sinks into the lava below.
If you do it right, you should land on a door, that will then use the book of the dead to open. From there, you unlock another world, called hell.
The real final boss is there, who is also pretty easy. Oh, and you need to do it all in one life(minus the Ankh part), or else you lose and it resets.
</p>
<p> As I had said, there are huge risks you need to take to get the biggest rewards you also have the option to do this while holding an easily breakable eggplant, that you can throw onto the true final boss to turn him into a 1hp eggplant demon king.
Even once you master the game, there are new challenges, such as killing every shopkeeper to get the best gear, causing hard battles each level, or you can try to maximise your score by a technique called ghosting.
If you take more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds on any non boss level a ghost appears. This ghost is damage  immune, and instantly kills you if you touch it.
Normally, this is cause for someone to exit the level and move onto the next one as quick as possible. However, when the ghost travels through a gem during its chase to reach and kill you,
it turns it into an extremely valuable diamond. This can be used to maximise your score, causing playthroughs that are 7 hours long, instead of the usual 15 minutes.

There are hundreds of little secrets that I just don't have the time to share with you, but none of them would be worthwhile without solid mechanics. 
The learning curve is incredibly high, leading most people to not complete the game, but the solid mechanics and tight movement really keep people engaged, no matter how bad they are.
There is also an immense variety in levels, because of the way it is generated, the levels always feel a little familiar, but are always different.
For those who have the resolve and the love of the game, they can play through every single infuriating moment, and discover something even better.
The game features a lot of different ways to die. It is an incredibly difficult game, after all. Some of these are just annoying, such as dying to a bat, others are incredibly wild.
The game could have an explosion caused by a pot that you threw landing just right, leading to an arrow from an exploded arrow trap launching out and dealing half your health, then, 
because of the knockback from the arrow, you land on an altar to kali, where you normally go to sacrifice things to gain items such as the kapala, which heals depending on the amount of blood you collect.
the altar instead sacrifices you, and you get turned into thowing gloves. This is just one example of the many that exist in the game. It has unlimited potential in what can happen, and I truly believe that that 
is what makes the game as good as it is. A game so good that I would rather play it over almost any other game. A game so good, that I think it deserves to be the first nominee of the Green Dolphin Award.
